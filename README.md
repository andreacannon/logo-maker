## Description
The Logo Generator is a command-line application that allows developers to quickly create a logo for their projects. By guiding users through a series of prompts, this tool generates a simple SVG logo based on user input. Users can choose a shape, specify colors, and enter text. The logo is saved as `logo.svg`.
This was created for UofMN coding Bootcamp through EdX.

2. Run `node index.js` to start the application.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your logo details.
4. A `logo.svg` file will be created in your project directory.
